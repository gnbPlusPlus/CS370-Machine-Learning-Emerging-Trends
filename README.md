# CS370-Machine-Learning-Emerging-Trends
Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
--
The project involved training an intelligent agent (a "pirate") to solve a maze by reaching the goal cell in a grid (the "treasure"). Auxilliary files were provided for the foundations of the game (GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py) as well as setup cells in the Jupyter Notebook file. The training code (nested loops, parameters) were created by me while the code for outputting the results and testing the agent post-training was prewritten.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
--
Computer scientists use different programming languages to translate the foundational binary communication and logic gates computers use to operate into human readable work and outcomes. Computer science is a highly abstracted field that grows in complexity as one steps further and further out in scope, culminating in powerful systems capable of letting humans spread knowledge and communicate globally. Without human innovation in the field, computers wouldn't be what they are today. Programming languages are learned languages, not inherently known, so for the field to continue to see growth and maintain staples of modern life, like The Internet, people who are well-versed in programming and other computer science concepts are necessary.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
--
I approach problems as a computer scientist by learning the basics of a language or framework, then leveraging pseudocode, documentation, and examples found in textbooks, articles, or online forums to solve specific needs. Knowing the foundations of the language/tool I'm working with helps me "translate" examples I see elsewhere into sensible steps, which then makes those steps more transferrable to my own problems. When I struggle, I collaborate with other students to discuss common issues and known solutions.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
--
My ethical responsibilities to the end user are to 1) not sell their personal information, 2) train models on unbiased, consensually-gained data, and 3) maintain transparency on the presence and innerworkings of any models in use. My ethical responsibilities to the organization are to 1) avoid the misuse of proprietary information, such as for unauthorized machine learning, 2) satisfy the end user in order to maximize product returns, and 3) adhere to the ethical duties laid out for the user to uphold the reputation of the organization.
